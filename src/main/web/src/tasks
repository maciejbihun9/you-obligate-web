 * poll for user account balance in given group:
 - poll for logged-in user account data - done,
 - place available amount of units to serve in the view
 - develop counting numbers

 * develop counting the result:
 - after receiving
 - after each

 + how to implement getting user account balance?:
 - the user account balance in given group,
 - user contains all accounts, should i poll for all accounts?
 - get all accounts in given obligation group and for given user,
 a user might have couple accounts, so specifying also an obligation group I will have
 the exact user account
 - a user can have only one account in given group,
 - get user account that exists in given obligation group,
 - get obligationGroup id

 * create a purchase coupons view:
 - provide test data for this view,
 - create a section for protecting against bad data case

 * add a feature that will be able to make a purchase:
 - click make a purchase button,
 - send the data to the server and check if the numbers are ok,
 and there,
 - send purchase object to the server
 - if numbers changed and are not updated then resent that
 to the user and update the UI,
 - if are ok then make a purchase,
 - withdraw the correct amount of units from the user account,
 - cut off the correct amount of update accounts,
 - provide an info about success full purchase,

 - save the data, but in the UI just show ui computations

 - if purchase was made success fully then just convenient status,
 depending on a status I will show info in the UI that everything was ok

 * show purchase details page

 questions:
 + what if object data is not ok?:
 - I should get bond with current data,
 - get this updated data object and update UI view,
 + what if purchase was made success fully?:
 + what if a user is requesting for data that is not updated
 he will receive an exception
 + what could I return from make purchase method?
 - I am not computing anything
 + what kind of a message to show?:
 - for now just show a message in logs
 + what to do after purchase?:
 - show page with purchase details
 + should I do that cosmetic details now?:
 - no, it is not needed,
