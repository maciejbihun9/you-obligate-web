 * create all application flow on the UI side,
 - I will know what kind of call I will make to get the data for it,
 - btw., I haven't tried that yet, so let's try it, bro!,

 * make available for users to scroll down the list of groups - done
 - users are able to view all of them

 * display obligation group home page - done,
 - obligation group name,

 * display list of bonds for given group - done:
 - user comes and he wants to see all
 issued bonds in the given obligation group,

 *

 questions:

 - a user will be searching by tags,

 + why a user might enter group view?:
 - he is looking for a service units, i want someones service for me,
 - when I go one the page i do not want to see all services
