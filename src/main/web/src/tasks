 * navigate to obligation group view:
 - I have obligation group stored in coupon,
 - get this obligation id and

 * display coupon data in the view:

 questions:
 + how to display coupon data?:
 - make a purchase for a coupon,
 - get this created coupon to the view
 - pass coupon data to the next view and

 + return different types in response entity

 + what to do when purchase was successfull?:
 - i am sending data that is already in the UI,
 - if server is ok with this data then i can display that data from the UI,
 - I do not need the same data coming from the server,
 I need just the right status from the server that everything went ok,
