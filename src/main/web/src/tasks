 + how to implement getting user account balance?:
 - the user account balance in given group,
 - user contains all accounts, should i poll for all accounts?
 - get all accounts in given obligation group and for given user,
 a user might have couple accounts, so specifying also an obligation group I will have
 the exact user account
 - a user can have only one account in given group,
 - get user account that exists in given obligation group,
 - get obligationGroup id

 - provide test data for this view,
 - create a section for protecting against bad data case
