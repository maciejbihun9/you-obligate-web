 * fix problem with removing cache after refresh:
 - actually hitting f5 this is what a user expects after that, he wants totally fresh copy
 of the data, right?,
 so if this is an expected behaviour then I have to provide section for clear cache copy
 - after refresh cache is lost,
 - after refresh on particular site cache is lost also, data is polled from the server, but
 it is not cached after all,

 implementation:
 - a user enters the page for the first time,
 - obligation groups are polled in the cache,
 - he gets bonds for it and displays,
 - bonds are saved in the cache,
 - bonds are not stored in cache just for now

 questions:
 +



 wnioski:
 - aplication effeciency ont at the end!!!
