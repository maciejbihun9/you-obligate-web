 * create grid in the middle of the page
 strategy #1: (Copy all grid from previous project):
 - copy super table from the other project,
 - poll test data, poll test group requests from test database,
 - create columns array, columns list

 * what could I do with <ng-content></ng-content> components?:
 - reusable components
 - like alert error component, alert success component

 * create grid for showing requests:

 questions:
 + should I make a design of entire page before I started developing any views?:
 - I won't go through all this planning, because I do not think it is really neccesery,
 - I do not want to create any design,
 - I will receive all views from my managers,
 - I am not a UI guy,
 - if you can make this kind of a plan then probably
 then you would be able to create reusable views,

 * after clicking group join request item, open an area under that item:
 - click <tr> and expand panel under this area,
 - mat-expansion-panel-header - this has to be the same content as in table
 - everything has to be in table row

 * update angular version to 7
