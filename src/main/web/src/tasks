 * fix problem with removing cache after refresh:
 - actually hitting f5 this is what a user expects after that, he wants totally fresh copy
 of the data, right?,
 so if this is an expected behaviour then I have to provide section for clear cache copy
 - after refresh cache is lost,
 - after refresh on particular site cache is lost also, data is polled from the server, but
 it is not cached after all,

 implementation:
 - a user enters the page for the first time,
 - obligation groups are polled in the cache,
 - he gets bonds for it and displays,
 - bonds are saved in the cache,
 - bonds are not stored in cache just for now

 * place bond data in the bond view:
 - do not care about placement, only content
 - purchase bond units
 - this will open another window to specify the amount of items to purchase
 - the data is already polled,
 - pass bond data just as a simple item

 questions:
 + what should be in the bond view?;
 - who issued it,
 - the amount of units to serve,
 - registered service data,
 - created date time,
 - unit of work cost
 - registered service informations

 * purchase coupons:
 - place everything in the middle,
 - create the same view as transfer wise,
 - click purchase coupons,
 - show another view,

 questions:
 + what to show on this view:
 - user account balance,
 - the amount of left units,
 - price for one unit
 - place where I can specify amount of units to buy

 + how to go to another page sending data and having list item

 wnioski:
 - aplication effeciency ont at the end!!!

 * pass data to angular component:
 - I can poll for the data using service because If I pass the data
 from a list
 - I am gonna poll for list item data every single time, because
 I want to have fresh copy of each item, i do not want to have stale data,
 I do not want to cache anything for now

 questions:
 + do I want to show purchase coupons in bond view?:
 - maybe for now I do not want to poll for purchase coupons, just simple registered service
