 * create all application flow on the UI side,
 - I will know what kind of call I will make to get the data for it,
 - btw., I haven't tried that yet, so let's try it, bro!,

 * make available for users to scroll down the list of groups - done
 - users are able to view all of them

 * display obligation group home page - done,
 - obligation group name,

 * display list of bonds for given group - done:
 - user comes and he wants to see all
 issued bonds in the given obligation group,

 * make a draft of a bond view:
 - do not care about styles, just much needed content,
 - if everything will be ok, then I will style it

 questions:
 + should I create all models in between?,

 * create bond view - done:
 - place there all info about bond itself,
 - place there a photo of an bond issuer,
 - place there an info about registered service,
 - do not think about styling just yet,
 - I have seen in previous projects that they were sending a lot of data and objects
 at once,
 - I will poll for bond data

 questions:
 + what should be on the bond item list to attract the user?:
 - a user will have possibility to see what is under the bond straight away,
 - he has to see on this bond list item at least category and service name,
 so i need to have registered service associated with bond
 - do not care about efficiency

 + user feelings after viewing this bond?
