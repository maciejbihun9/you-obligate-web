 * implement how new users might got along with a group owner:
 - a new user finds a new group,
 - he sees all obligation groups and their details,
 - he sees all bonds and prices and service units,
 - he sees all prices,
 - this person will see all bonds issued by users and will
 see obligation strategies,
 - they will see amount of bonds issued,
 and prices and all the amount of money created
 by this group, the amount of wealth,
 - he will send a request to the group participia

 * design a protocol for accepting new users - strategy #1 - weak and very basic:
 - a group user receives a request,
 - he will receive all details about a user,
 - a user might provide a lot of info, CV, docs, desc,
 - a user reads all of it and makes a decision and sets his numbers,
 - all users sets those numbers, then we will get an average of that,
 - then we will wait for a response

 * design a protocol for accepting new users - strategy #2:

 concerns:
 - people are damn lazy,
 - it looks like fucking HR department,

 questions:
 + should he see all debt?:
 - I can brake all rules,
 - People want to show their impact, they want to show how they
 interact with env
 + how a user might ask for a group join?:
 - he might make a simple request to a group owner,
 - an owner will receive a request, he will show all request details to his
 group friends
 - there might be a lot of this kind of requests, so people will be demolished by stream of requests,
 but if you want to maintain an alternative load market, credit market then
 - a user will send a request with his proposition
 - there might be a situation where a user won't send anything, because
 he sees that there are bad proportions,
 - it will be hard to investigate all user, all people that want to join specific group
 - maybe at the beginning,
 - this is going to be an another fun system for other people,
 + a user wants to join a group, is sanding a request to all people in the group,
 but people in the group they do not know the real prices of a particular service
