 * read about caching in Angular:
 - read once, if I won't understand then I will try to read about those aspects i do not understand

 * store obligation groups data:
 solution #1 (read about caching in angular):

 * display bond data in the bond view:

 * caching data:
 strategy #1 (mapping obligation groups):
 - user picks an obligation group,
 - obligation group with all data is polled from
 the database and that is stored on the client side,
 - he goes to another group, another group data is polled,
 - he goes back to previous group, but in this case the data is polled from the cache,
 - each minute if changes were made the data is updated,
 the server pushes new data and the UI is updated,
 - we can make a feature when there is not many service units left to update UI more frequently,
 - cache obligation groups in the application

 implementation:
 - poll for all obligation groups - done,
 - receive the data and store it in a map - done,
 - make a real http call under real url - done,
 - find good url for your http call - done,
 - create a controller for obligation groups - done,
 - poll for bonds associated with given obligation group - done,
 - recall how to create good url in the application - done,
 - create a map {obligation_group_id, obligation group + bonds and all the data} - done,
 - if the id already exists then i will get it from this map instead of getting it from the server,
 - when user clicks specific obligation group then poll for all bonds associated with it and associate
 it with given object
 - I am gonna fetch only bond, because i am gonna need that

 questions:

 * updating application data:
 - count time from entering the page
 - after each 10min poll for the data for all obligation groups that exists in cache,
 - one obligation group might be longer in cache than others but it does not matter,
 - for now I will just set new array, later if this will be slow i will change it,
 - I will poll for obligation groups with bonds, because this is the only way to fetch
 the data,
 - set the new cache,
 - I have a reference to all cached obligation groups,
 - if reference changes then all items in a list will change also,
 - if not then i will create a subject and i will send it over observable,

 * learn how to test angular application
