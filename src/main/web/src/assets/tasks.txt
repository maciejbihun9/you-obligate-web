 * creating application tips:
 - create just simple ui,
 - make sure that those views, those ui views will be used and necessery
 - I have to know exactly what I will need, what kind of models,
 - this is my project, so i will develop later what i will need,
 - the same as they are creating buildings, first, they create fundaments
 for what they need, we have walls - then we have light bulbs -
 first we have walls,, noone,
 - maybe later it iwll be worthless to create another repo, another service, controller for all those unused models,
 creating tests,
 - noone installs neons before car is ready to go on normal ways, normal roads,
 - noone puts seats in not ready car, because you can make it dirty,
 - ui is not a package, is a part of a product,
 - UI and backend has to be like one monolitic posture,
 - I need to to good on ui, so I will create entire ui first,
 - we wont test until is done, until we know, and we sure we need it,
 - cars do not have crash tests until we have,
 - if a user does not like the all picture,
 - like a car - I want to see the whole picture of it man, that i know I gonna love it!,
 - like at the beginning - i show people a pic how my, maybe they gonna say that no at first,
 - people love this package shit, they do not care this is hard to maintain,
 - girls love this, they love package,
 - money that is backed by people services, what they provide
