 * display in the grid column names instead of column ids:
 strategy #1 - (column ids from data array objects):
 - send columns names as strings,
 - in expanded table get ids from array objects,
 - use those ids to get values from objects

 * Display group-join-request data in expanded row:
 - for now display that in random order
